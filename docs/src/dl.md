## Syntax

The grammar is based on [PanDoc Definition lists](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#definition-lists)

Each term must be on one line, optionally followed by a blank line. After a term, it must be followed by one or more definitions.

Each definition needs to start with `:` or `~` and be followed by one or more definition paragraphs. When multiple block elements are defined, subsequent block elements should be indented by four spaces.

If there is a blank line after the term, the definition text will be treated as a paragraph, otherwise a compact list will be displayed.
